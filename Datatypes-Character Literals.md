# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'S'` and `'k'` using character literals.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Print the character `'S'`.
2. Print the character `'k'`.

## 🧾 Program
```
a='S'
b='k'
print(a)
print(b)
```

## Output
<img width="642" height="169" alt="{4B2A356C-7675-4942-978B-3F97FA5BAEA3}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c08bbb-7f7a-4096-95b5-f17d7751ffa6" />


## Result
Therefore the program that prints the characters `'S'` and `'k'` using character literals is compiled and the output is verified successfully.
